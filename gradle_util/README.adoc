Inspired by http://saulmm.github.io/squeezing-gradle-builds too.
This script help you unify your android build tool in same version.

== package_exclude.py
Exclude duplicate resources in **META-INF**.
If you run into package problem, this script can automatically find the duplicate resources.

* Perhaps package_exclude.py can write a gradle plugin.
But for now, I have no no idea of writing one.
